"""
Momentary open/close handling for contact sensors.

Alarm.com collapses a quick open-then-close into a single OpenedClosed event
(type 100). Writing its literal SensorState.OPENED_CLOSED (9) made the opening
invisible in Home Assistant: on/off is derived from state parity and 9 is odd,
so the sensor read closed, never changed state, and left nothing in history for
an automation to see. Confirmed on a real system - a five-second front door
open produced no entry at all, while an open held for 30 seconds (a plain
Opened, type 15) showed up immediately.
