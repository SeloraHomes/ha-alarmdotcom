"""
Device registry usage, held to the APIs that survive HA Core 2027.

Three deprecations were reported in #101, all of them on paths this integration
takes on every setup:

* ``DeviceInfo["via_device"]`` — the identifier-tuple form of the parent link,
  removed in HA Core 2027.8 in favour of ``via_device_id`` (a registry id);
* ``DeviceRegistry.async_get_device(identifiers=...)`` — ambiguous across config
  entries, superseded by ``async_get_device_by_identifier``;
* ``device_registry.devices`` used as a mapping — removed in HA Core 2027.9.

The last one is not merely a warning on current betas: it raises. These tests
assert the shape of what we emit and the helpers we call, so a regression fails
here rather than in a user's log.
